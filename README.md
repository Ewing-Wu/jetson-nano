## Who does what ? 

- `jn_sd_resize.sh` resizes the SD card partitions to use all instead of the original 16GB. (Tested of JetPack4.3). Thanks to [this post](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1050105/jetson-nano/jetson-nano-sd-card-partitions-can-not-extend-/post/5393113/#5393113) on nvidia dev forum.
- `create_8Gswap.sh`, creates an 8GB swap memory on disk. Pretty practical for installation. Thanks to [this post](https://jkjung-avt.github.io/setting-up-nano/).
